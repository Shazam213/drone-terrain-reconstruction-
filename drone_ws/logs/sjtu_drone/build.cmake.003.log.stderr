[31m[1mCMake Error[0m at /home/soham/drone_ws/src/sjtu-drone/CMakeLists.txt:15 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findgazebo.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "gazebo", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "gazebo" with any
  of the following names:

    gazeboConfig.cmake
    gazebo-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "gazebo" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "gazebo_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "gazebo"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
